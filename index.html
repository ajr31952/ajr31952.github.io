	<h1 style="color:blue; text-align:center; font-family:verdana;"> Andrew Robertson: A Fictional Biography</h1>
	<h2 style="color:red;" > My Family and My Childhood </h2>
	<p> My mother's family hails from the great country of Cuba. My mother came from Cuba 
	at the ripe age of seven and lived in Miami. Her name is Mayra Perez Robertson. My father
	went to North Georgia College and served in Vietnam War as a sergeant. His name is William
	Carlton Robertson Jr. I have one older brother whose name is William Carlton Robertson III. 
	He graduated from St.Pius X Catholic High School in 2013. He attended Augusta University as a 
	pitcher on a scholarship. My Abuela is the only living grandparent of mine. My cousins and I go 
	to her house every Sunday to eat lunch. Going to lunch every Sunday with my cousins has taught me 
	that family is important and you need to spend time with them. Because of my heritage, my three favorite colors are red,
	white, and blue because those three colors are represented on both the American flag and the Cuban flag.

<body>
	<p> I never enjoyed working out in high school because it felt like an obligation coaches would force me into doing to get stronger. Because of those reasons,
	 I never took the training seriously. Once I got to college, I found myself bored with all the free time I had. My friends and I started working out together 
	 five times a week and I have set personal goals for myself in the weight room. From working out in the last year,<b> I have already gained over 10 pounds!!!</b>

<h1 style="color:red;"> My College Experience </h1>
<body>
	<p> Out of high school, I was not accepted to UGA. Therefore, I made plans to trasnfer here for the fall of my sophmore
	year of college. Because the UGA requirement to have completed 30 hours before even applying to UGA as a transfer student,
	I chose to take summer classes at Kennesaw State right after graduating high school. To make sure my classes 
	transferred, I used the <a href="https://www1.admissions.uga.edu/transfer_equiv/TransferEquiv/Index"> UGA transfer equivancy chart </a>
	which saved me from taking useless classes that would have prevented me from being here now.
